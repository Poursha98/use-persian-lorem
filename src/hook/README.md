# Persian Lorem Ipsum for React

this is very simple, just oepn {} within your jsx element and write `usePersianLorem(wordNum)` and you are good to go :)

- wordNum is the number of the words you'll have within your jsx element. the default value is 100 (in case you don't want to pass a number to it)

Thats it. I hope you to enjoy !
